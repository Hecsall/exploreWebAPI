
# **Explore Web API**

This is just a git containing some experiments with unknown/underused Web APIs that are available on modern browsers.

All the developments contained in this repository are tested only on Chrome (currently v84).


### **Notes on code:**
Each "experiment" will have it's own folder to keep single concepts on their own without depending on external folder's files.\
If some layout styles are needed, i will include [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in the head section of HTML files, just to have some basic ready-to-use styles without adding weight to the project.\
I'll try to comment as much as i can to keep the code simple and easily understandable.
